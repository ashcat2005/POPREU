#Deploying the Star-Galaxy Classification Algorithm
##Generating the Model
Using [Random Forest for Star-Galaxy Classification](https://github.com/beatriceliang/POPREU/blob/master/stargalaxy.ipynb), we generated Random Forest models with 4, 10, 50, and 400 trees.  They all had a depth of 10.
##Downloading the CFHTLens Data
We downloaded all of the CFHTLens Data and put them onto the Hadoop Filesystem using [this code](https://github.com/beatriceliang/POPREU/blob/master/get_cfhtlens.py)
